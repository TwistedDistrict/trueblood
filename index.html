		<h2>About True Blood</h2>
	<img src="images/Season1.jpg" alt="True Blood DVD Cover"/>
	<p>True Blood is an American television series created and produced by Alan Ball. It is based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries series of novels by Charlaine Harris, detailing the co-existence of vampires and humans in Bon Temps, a fictional, small town in the state of Louisiana. The series centers on the adventures of Sookie Stackhouse (played by actress Anna Paquin), a telepathic waitress.</p>
	<p>The show is broadcast on the premium cable network HBO in the United States. It is produced by HBO in association with Ball's production company, Your Face Goes Here Entertainment.[1] It premiered on September 7, 2008. The series has received critical acclaim and won several awards, including one Golden Globe and an Emmy. The show's second 12-episode season had its premiere on June 14, 2009 and the third season on June 13, 2010. On June 21, 2010, HBO renewed True Blood for a fourth season. On August 11, 2011, HBO announced that True Blood had been renewed for a fifth season of 12 episodes to air in summer 2012.

	<p>Sookie (the star of the show) never assumed dating a vampire would be a piece of cake, but now twice-orphaned, the telepathic waitress has had her life turned upside down by the supernatural. While her friends and family all struggle with their own demons — sometimes literally — Sookie does her best to navigate the strange new world Bill has introduced her to. Their relationship fills her with equal parts bliss and fear, but the one thing that worries her most is that maybe she’s not as horrified as she should be.</p>

	<p class="endfloat">Thanks to a Japanese scientist's invention of synthetic blood, vampires have progressed from legendary monsters to fellow citizens overnight. And while humans have been safely removed from the menu, many remain apprehensive about these creatures "coming out of the coffin." Religious leaders and government officials around the world have chosen their sides, but in the small Louisiana town of Bon Temps, the jury is still out.</p>

	<p>Local waitress Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), however, knows how it feels to be an outcast. "Cursed" with the ability to listen in on people's thoughts, she's also open-minded about the integration of vampires -- particularly when it comes to Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a handsome 173-year-old living up the road. But at the service of Bill's less virtuous vampire associates, Sookie is drawn into a series of catastrophes that will put their love to the test.</p>

	<p>The latest hit series from 'Six Feet Under' creator Alan Ball, 'True Blood' delves into the meticulously-crafted world of novelist Charlaine Harris. Described by the Emmy®-winning Ball as "popcorn for smart people," the first season of 'True Blood' caused an overnight sensation -- and the new installments only build on his colorful cast of supernatural misfits.</p></div>
